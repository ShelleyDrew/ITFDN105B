d. int ix = objy;

ANSWER: c


2.Which of the followings is considered unboxing?

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

3.Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = objdblx;

ANSWER: float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;


4.Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object to another variable of type double.

double dx = objflx;

ANSWER: double dx = (double)(float)objflx;


5.Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = 

ANSWER: double dblx = strx.ToDouble();


6.Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = 

ANSWER: float fx = ix;


7.Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx =

ANSWER: string strx = dblx.ToString();


8.Object is the                  class of all other data types.
